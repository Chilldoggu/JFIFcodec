# JFIF codec
---
Decided to make yet another JFIF codec because I wanted to understand how JPEG standard works as there's not that much technical explanations on the internet (and standard is black magic). This project is my first time using C but I'm trying my best. This would be extra hard without a book "John Miano - Compressed image file formats - JPEG, PNG, GIF, XBM, BMP (1999)".

At this point I'm focusing on decoding a single sequential (baseline) mode file.
